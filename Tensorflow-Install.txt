Installing TensorFlow on Windows
	https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows

Take the following steps to install TensorFlow in an Anaconda environment:
	Follow the instructions on the Anaconda download site to download and install Anaconda.
	Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:
		C:> conda create -n tensorflowGPU 
	Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:
		C:> activate tensorflowGPU
 		(tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change 
	To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command (on a single line):
		(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl 

Validate your TensorFlow installation by doing the following:
	Start a terminal.
	If you installed through Anaconda, activate your Anaconda environment.
	Inside that terminal, invoke python:
		C:> python 
	Enter the following short program inside the python interactive shell:
		>>> import tensorflow as tf
		hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
		sess = tf.Session()
		print(sess.run(hello))
 	If the Python program outputs the following, then the installation is successful and you can begin writing TensorFlow programs. (If you are new to TensorFlow, see Getting Started with TensorFlow.)
		Hello, TensorFlow!
	If the system generates an error message instead of a greeting, see the next section.
